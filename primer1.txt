AIR TRANSPORT
1. Modern air transport, using craft that is heavier than air, requires a lot of power to simply speak in the air. It is for this reason that air transport uses more fuel to carry a ton over a mile distance than land or watercraft. Another disadvantage of air transport is that, while a ship, truck or train whose engines break down can stall until they are fixed, the plane with the problem must land. This means that the aircraft must have multiple engines, and this increases its cost. Air transport security measures also tend to be expensive. It cannot be relied upon for regular services in locations or seasons with low clouds and fog. The great advantage of air transport is its high speed, all civilized countries are trying to develop it. If you want to save time, you will naturally fly by air.
